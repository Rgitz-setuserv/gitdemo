How to make Onion Uttapam

Step 1
To prepare this delicious Onion Uttapam, soak the dal and rice in water,
separately, for around 2-3 hours. Once done, drain the excess water. 
Now add the dal and rice in separate blenders and grind them to a smooth
batter. Transfer both dal and rice batter in a large bowl and add enough salt.
Mix well and keep aside.

Step 2
Now heat little oil in a pan over medium flame. Add onions in it and 
saute them till they turn slightly pinkish in colour. Then add ginger 
and green chillies. Saute for another minute. Once done, add this mixture
to the batter and mix well. Just make sure that the batter is neither
too thick nor too thin.

Step 3
Heat a tawa over medium flame and pour a ladleful of the batter on the 
tawa. Spread the batter in a circular motion to a thick uttapam.
Apply oil around the edges of the uttapam and cook on both sides. 
Once the uttapam is properly cooked, transfer it to a serving plate
and pair it with hot bowl of sambhar and different types of chutneys
